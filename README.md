# Micro-Router
This project sets out to solve a simple but nitche problem, when using any form of hotspot in a large area covergae can suffer. Using a mesh-network of Micro-Routers coverage area can be extended for a short time without running any cables. Each Micro-Router uses a [Carambola2](https://www.8devices.com/products/carambola-2) SOM running [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), A 3.3v TP4056 charging circut, and has serial output over usb using a CP2102N-Axx-xQFN20.
